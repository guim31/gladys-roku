# Roku

Control your **Roku streaming players** (Express, Streaming Stick, Ultra…) and
your **Roku TVs** (TCL, Hisense, onn., Sharp, Philips, Westinghouse, Roku-made
TVs…) from Gladys: power, the app on screen, playback, remote keys, volume and
inputs, on the dashboard and in your scenes.

Everything stays **on your home network**: Gladys talks to the Roku with the
External Control Protocol (ECP) Roku documents for its devices. No Roku
account, no cloud, no API key.

> **Developed without the hardware: feedback welcome.** This integration was
> built from Roku's documentation and from real answers of Roku devices
> recorded by other open-source projects, not on a Roku in a living room. If
> something does not work as described here, please open an issue (see
> [Reporting a problem](#reporting-a-problem)): it will get fixed fast.

## Before you start: allow control from your network

Recent versions of Roku OS block control from other devices by default. On
**each** Roku:

1. Press **Home** on the Roku remote, open **Settings > System > Advanced
   system settings > Control by mobile apps**.
2. Open **Network access** and choose **Enabled**.
   - **Limited** (the default on recent Roku OS versions) only allows
     launching apps and typing text: the remote keys are refused, and
     depending on the Roku OS version, so is what Gladys reads.
   - **Disabled** refuses everything.
   - **Permissive** works too, but opens the Roku to any device, even outside
     your network: **Enabled** is enough for Gladys.

On a **Roku TV**, also turn on **Settings > System > Power > Fast TV start**.
Without it, a TV in standby goes deaf to the network: Gladys can neither turn
it on nor tell that it is off rather than unplugged.

Give each Roku a fixed address in your router (a "DHCP reservation"): Gladys
finds a Roku that changed address again, but it takes a scan.

## Installation

1. Install the **Roku** integration from the integration store of Gladys.
2. Open its **Discovery** tab and run a scan: every Roku on the same network
   as Gladys answers within a few seconds.
3. Click **Add to Gladys** on each Roku you want. Done.

A Roku the scan does not find (another subnet or VLAN, a mesh network that
filters discovery…)? In the **Configuration** tab, type its IP address in
**Roku addresses** (several addresses separated by commas), save, and scan
again. The **Test the connection to a Roku** action takes an address too: it
tells you right away whether the Roku answers and accepts control, and adds it
to the Discovery tab when it does.

The address of a Roku is shown on the Roku in **Settings > Network > About**.

## What you get

Each Roku becomes one Gladys device:

| Feature     | Roku players                                                                           | Roku TVs                                                                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Power       | state (on / standby)                                                                   | on / off, and its state                                                                    |
| Application | the app on screen, and a list to open another one (or Home)                            | same                                                                                       |
| Input       | –                                                                                      | HDMI 1-4, antenna (Live TV), AV, or Roku streaming, with the names you gave them on the TV |
| Playback    | playing or not                                                                         | playing or not                                                                             |
| Remote keys | Home, Back, arrows, OK, Options (\*), Play/Pause, Rewind, Fast forward, Instant replay | same, plus Volume up, Volume down, Mute, Channel up/down (with a tuner)                    |

States are refreshed every 10 seconds. The list of apps is read again every
15 minutes, and as soon as an app the list did not have comes to the screen.

### What a Roku cannot do (and so Gladys neither)

- **No volume level.** Roku's protocol only has the Volume up, Volume down and
  Mute keys: there is no "set the volume to 20", no way to read the current
  level, nor to know whether the sound is muted. Gladys offers the keys, and
  tells nothing it cannot know.
- **Roku players cannot be turned off.** A Roku Express, Stick or Ultra has no
  real power state: Gladys shows whether it is active or in standby, but only
  a Roku TV can be turned on and off.
- **Turning on a TV in deep standby** needs **Fast TV start** (see above).
  When the TV does not answer, Gladys sends it a Wake-on-LAN packet first:
  whether the TV wakes up depends on the model, and works more often over
  Ethernet than over Wi-Fi.
- **Volume and power keys of a player** (Roku Voice Remote buttons that drive
  your TV through HDMI-CEC or infrared) are not reachable over the network.
- **Typing text** goes through a scene only (see
  [Typing a text](#typing-a-text-search-login)): no dashboard field can send
  text to an integration yet.

## Dashboard

Four widgets come with the integration (Gladys 5.1 or later). Each one shows
the Roku picked in its settings, or the first one.

- **Roku remote** — power and app on screen, then **Power** (Roku TV) or
  **Play/Pause** (player), **Home**, **Back** and **OK**. A widget holds four
  buttons at most: put the **Roku navigation** widget next to it for the
  arrows; every other key (volume, mute…) is on the device page and in the
  "Press a Roku remote key" scene action.
- **Roku navigation** — the four arrows: Up, Down, Left, Right.
- **Roku playback** — the icon and name of the app on screen, playing or
  paused, the position in the video while one is open, and Play/Pause,
  Rewind, Fast forward, Instant replay.
- **Roku apps** — **four app shortcuts at most** per widget, with their icons
  (a limit of the Gladys dashboard). Left empty, the settings show the first
  four apps installed; **type the names you want** in the widget settings
  (e.g. `Disney+`, `KiKA`, `YouTube`: case and accents do not matter). For
  more, add a second **Roku apps** widget with four other names. The app on
  screen is marked.

**Every installed app**, without limit, is in the **Application** feature of
the device: add the device to a regular **Devices** box to pick any app from a
list, or use it in a scene with "Set device value" (the TV inputs are
in the **Input** feature of a Roku TV).

The features of the device can also be added to any regular dashboard box.

## Scenes

The integration adds its own cards to the scene editor, under the
**Integrations** category:

- **Roku app changed** (trigger) — starts the scene when an app comes to the
  screen, within about 10 seconds. Optionally pick the Roku and type the app
  name **exactly as the Roku shows it** (e.g. `Netflix`, or `Home` for the
  home screen). The next actions can use the app name and its Roku id.
  Example: _when Netflix starts on the living room TV, dim the lights_.
- **Open an app on a Roku** (action) — opens an installed app by its name.
  Example: _movie night: turn the TV on, open Netflix_.
- **Press a Roku remote key** (action) — any key, as many times as needed,
  including Turn on and Turn off for a Roku TV. Example: _when the doorbell
  rings, press Play/Pause_.

- **Type a text on a Roku** (action) — types a text in the field shown on
  the Roku, see below.

The power and playback states are regular device features: a scene can start
when the TV turns off, or check that something is playing.

### Typing a text (search, login)

Gladys has no text field on the dashboard that an integration can receive
yet. The workaround:

1. On the Roku, open the field (a search, the email of a login…).
2. In Gladys, create a scene with the **Type a text on a Roku** action and
   the text to type (100 characters at most).
3. Add a **Scene** box to your dashboard with that scene: one tap types the
   text.

Do **not** put a sensitive password in a scene: every Gladys user can read the
scenes. The integration never writes the typed text in its logs.

## Troubleshooting

**"… refuses remote control"** (in the Configuration tab, a widget or an
action): the Roku is set to Limited or Disabled. Set **Control by mobile apps

> Network access** to **Enabled** (see
> [Before you start](#before-you-start-allow-control-from-your-network)), then
> run **Test the connection to a Roku**.

**The scan finds nothing.** Gladys and the Roku must be on the same network
(same subnet, no guest Wi-Fi, no client isolation). Type the address of the
Roku in **Roku addresses**, save, and scan again.

**The Roku shows as off while it is on.** It does not answer anymore: check its
address (it may have changed), then run **Test the connection to a Roku**.

**A Roku TV does not turn on.** Turn on **Fast TV start** on the TV. If it is
connected by Wi-Fi, Wake-on-LAN may not reach it while asleep.

**An app is missing from the list.** The list is read every 15 minutes: wait,
or open the app once on the Roku.

## Reporting a problem

1. In the **Configuration** tab, turn on **Debug logs** and save.
2. Reproduce the problem, then copy the logs of the integration (Integration
   page > Logs).
3. Open an issue on
   [github.com/guim31/gladys-roku](https://github.com/guim31/gladys-roku/issues)
   with the logs, your Roku model and its Roku OS version (Settings > System >
   About). The logs hold no password; they show the Roku model, its address on
   your network and its serial number.

Turn the debug logs off afterwards: they are verbose.
